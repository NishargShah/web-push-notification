# Firebase Push Notification

1. Define the firebase config to the `public/firebase-messaging-sw.js`
2. Fill the all credentials in a `src/config.js`
3. You will get the JSON if you are in active stage or in background you will receive the push notification
4. Enjoy

**NOTE**

1. wait for 10 min, if you are getting `notRegistered` in your response because token is expired, and it takes time sometime to refresh the token
2. If you are looking for next.js solution this structure will work fine, but you need to add custom server file for that https://medium.com/@sarafathulla/how-to-add-firebase-push-notifications-in-next-js-react-8eecc56b5cab
