# Firebase Push Notification

1. Define the firebase config to the `public/firebase-messaging-sw.js`
2. Fill the all credentials in a `src/config.js`
3. You will get the JSON if you are in active stage or in background you will receive the push notification
4. Enjoy

**NOTE**

1. wait for 10 min, if you are getting `notRegistered` in your response because token is expired, and it takes time sometime to refresh the token
